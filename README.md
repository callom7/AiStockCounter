Major Research Project: AI Image Recognition and Stock Counting                                                             
The objective of my undergraduate dissertation was to use AI as a means of streamlining warehouse stock management; in order to reduce the manual work load of the business. Ultimately, seeking to reduce operational costs and improve accuracy and reliability of stock database records. 
•	Implemented image processing techniques to detect and count products in scanned images
•	Utilised deep learning models for object detection to accurately identify different products within images
•	Integrated the system with Odoo, by exporting stock count data in a .txt format compatible with the bespoke data import function I developed for seamless integration
•	Successfully reduced stock counting time by 70%, leading to increased operational efficiency
•	Documented the project thoroughly, including codebase, model architectures, and integration steps
•	Logged potential improvements that could be made to the project including, a better model for higher accuracy detections, a guide on importance of lighting and optimal camera distance from the object
•	Presented the project to stakeholders, showcasing how the AI-driven stock counting process enhanced inventory accuracy and reduced manual efforts
